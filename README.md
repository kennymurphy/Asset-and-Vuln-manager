# Asset-and-Vuln-manager
Application to manage asset and their Vulnerabilities.  

This project will consist of 3 elements 
1. Web application (Possibly node.js)
2. middleware (Possibly Elasticsearch)
3. database (Currently looking at Mongodb)

The idea is that a user will be able to upload their assets list to the DB and then a .csv file with Vulnerabilities a check will be carried out to assign the vulnerabilities to assets or vice versa.

The front end application will produce graphs etc. (requirements to be defined) and eventually assign tickets to users.

Im learning most of this technology from scratch so this may take some time!!!
